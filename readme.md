We frame structure-based drug design as a Reinforcement Learning task, where the goal is to search the wider chemical space for
molecules with desirable properties as opposed to fitting a training data distribution. We propose TacoGFN, a Generative Flow
Network conditioned on protein pocket structure, using binding affinity, drug-likeliness and synthesizability measures as our reward. 

Empirically, our method outperforms state-of-art methods on the CrossDocked2020 benchmark for every molecular property (Vina score, QED, SA), while improving the generation time by multiple orders of magnitude. TACOGFN achieves âˆ’8.82 in median docking score and 52.63% in Novel Hit Rate.

If you have any problems or need help with the code, please add an issue or contact tonyzshen@gmail.com.

### Setup

Before running any scripts, please download the necessary package:

https://figshare.com/s/2738ce20d82463227113

This package includes:
- trained model weights
- pre-computed pharmacophores in lmdb
- saved pocket-graphs in lmdb
- misc files (data splitting, avg vina score, pocket centroid, generated molecules)

Set current directory into pythonpath.
```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$PWD
```

Please also setup up Conda Environment and install neccessary dependencies.
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate tacogfn
cd src/molvoxel
pip install -e .
```

### Training TacoGFN

If you wish to re-train the model we provide the HPS for 3 model variants
presented in our paper:

- TacoGFN: hps/crossdocked_mo_256.json
- TacoGFN (ZINCDock-15M): hps/zinc_mo_256.json
- TacoGFN no pocket conditioning: hps/zinc_mo_256_noph.json

Note: TacoGFN_ranked is the same model as TacoGFN - we just generate 500 instead
of 100 molecules at inference time, and rank by predicted docking score. The 
inference script takes care of that. 

```bash
python3 src/tacogfn/tasks/pharmaco_frag.py --hps_path "$HPS_PATH"
```

### Generating molecules and computing metrics

If you just wish to generate molecules and evaluate them, we also provide trained
models files. The following scripts re-generates molecules and computes metrics
on them (Docking needs to be computed seperatly).

```bash
bash scripts/generate_and_evaluate.sh
```

Note if you have re-trained a model, you can specify your model path to generate
and evaluate the performance. You can set $NUM_PER_POCKET to 100 for normal runs.
If you'd like to run TacoGFN_ranked, please change $NUM_PER_POCKET to 500.
```bash
python3 src/tasks/generate_molecules.py \
        --model_path "$MODEL_PATH" \
        --num_per_pocket $NUM_PER_POCKET \
        --comment "${COMMENT}"

python3 src/tasks/evaluate_molecules.py \
    --molecules_path "misc/generated_molecules/1.0_1.0_${NUM_PER_POCKET}_${COMMENT}.json"
```

### Aggregating and displaying metrics

To display the metrics, we provide the generated molecules from our model and
baseline models in misc/evaluations. The following scripts computes the metrics
used in Table 1 and Table 2:

```bash
bash scripts/see_all_results.sh
```

Note if you've generated molecules from a trained model, please compute docking 
scores using QVina 2.1 first. Then you could call the following: 

```bash
python3 src/tasks/aggergate_evals.py --eval_path "$EVAL_FILE"
```
